Install Nodejs
    
NodeJs + NPM


NPM :
   
   
   NPM (Node Package Manager): 
    1. websote
    2. CLI (command like interface)
    3. Registery

BootsStrap wan to onboard to NPM registery :

consider it as plain register.
BootsStrap team asks NPM register to make 1 entry for them :

Name: BootsStrap
github REPO: <URL>
Lincess: Open spurce related lincese(MIT)


----------------> Generates/PUBLIsh --------> bootsstrap library

npm init

Problem statment :

want to use bootsstrap library by bot in a brute force manner rather wan to use it via package manager.
here we are using mpm as package manager.
here package means library name in our case it would be bootsstrap.
