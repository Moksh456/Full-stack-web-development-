Promises :

    can land up in  states :

    1. Pending 
    2. Fullfill
    3. Rejected

    Promise in js is object that holds these properties :

        [[PromiseState]]: "pending"
        [[PromiseResult]]: undefined

        Here PromiseState is already discussed and can fall into 3 states :
        1. pending 
        2. fullfilled
        3. Rejected

        PromiseResult can be : 
            When state of promise is "Pending", at that time...PromiseResult will be undefined 
            when state of promise is "fullfilled" or "Rejected", at that time...PromiseResult
            will hold some DATA.


            Syntax:

            let promise = new Promise(<callback_fn>) :
            <callback_fn> is also known as executor.
            now this <callback_fn> takes 2 calbacks as input.
            General name convention of these callback is - resolve and reject.

            here resolve is called whenever we want promise state to change to "fullfilled".
            Reject is called whenever we want promise state to change to "Rejected".
